## ✨ Highlights

> **SuYan** keeps artwork, positive/negative prompts, categories, tags, and replaceable terms in one local library — searchable, reusable, and easy to share.

- 🗂️ **Local first** — data stays on your machine; no cloud account required
- 🖼️ **Image + prompt together** — browse, edit, copy, and share in one flow
- ✨ **AI when you need it** — split parameters, expand terms, reverse-prompt, translate, optimize; works offline without AI
- 🧹 **Easy cleanup** — compress, dedupe, batch import/export

---

## 🚀 Features

Browse in everyday order. Each section lists capabilities, then shows a demo GIF.

### 🏠 Library browse

- **Masonry gallery** — card view for image / video prompts; column count adjustable
- **Full-text search** — title, filename, prompt text, or tags
- **Filter & sort** — category, tag, favorites; by import / modified time, size, or random
- **Favorites** — star items and view them alone

### 📥 Import

- **Import images** — batch add local files
- **Mount folders** — index existing image / video folders without copying the source media
- **Paste** — clipboard images go straight in
- **Import documents** — extract images and prompts from Word
- **Import shares** — ZIP packages or shared web links

#### Local import

Left sidebar **Import** → **Import images**, multi-select local files; paste and Word import also work.

#### Network import

Paste a share link; SuYan downloads remote images and prompts. Configure **Network proxy** first if the site needs it.

<img src="./photo/网络素材导入.gif" alt="Network import" width="860" />

#### Share package

Export a ZIP (images + prompts) from detail or **Batch manage**; the other side uses **Import share** — no account required.

### 🗂️ Batch manage

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is SuYan paid? What if someone sells the installer?</b></summary>

**A:** No. MIT open source, always free — no paid unlock or membership.  
If someone sells packages or charges install fees, **report it**, do not pay; download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/guliacer/SuYan/releases).  
Send evidence to [Issues](https://github.com/guliacer/SuYan/issues). Verified cases go to [Paid listings](#-paid-listings).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Where is my library? Is it uploaded?</b></summary>

**A:** On your machine by default. Browse and edit offline. Network is used only when you call remote AI, parse share links, or download remote images.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I use images already on disk?</b></summary>

**A:** Left sidebar **Import** → **Add folder** scans existing image/video folders. Media stays in place; the app only stores indexes, size/mtime, and thumbnail cache — it does **not** copy source media. Deleting a library entry does not delete the original file.

Each mounted folder can enable **Watch this folder** (off by default). While enabled, new media is indexed automatically; removals are marked missing without deleting the index or source files. Uniquely identifiable renames update the stored relative path; otherwise it becomes "old entry missing + new entry added". Turning watching off stops automatic synchronization.

You can also validate, re-locate, incrementally rescan, or unmount from **Material folders**. After re-locating, items recover by original relative paths.

ZIP shares read external sources and embed media into the package (no in-library copy required). External items are not compressed/transcoded in-app and are never overwritten in place; create a managed copy via normal import first if you need compression.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I handle missing source files?</b></summary>

**A:** If a mount is disconnected or files were moved/deleted on disk, cards show **source missing** (both masonry and batch manage).

- If files only moved: **re-locate** the mount under **Material folders** to restore by relative paths.
- If the originals are gone for good and only missing indexes remain: open **Material folders**, then use the **clean** action on that folder row (tooltip: clear prompt indexes for deleted files under this folder). It removes missing-file indexes and app thumbnail cache for that root only — it does **not** delete remaining files on disk or affect other folders.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I configure AI?</b></summary>

**A:** Open **Model settings**, add endpoint, model, and API key. Right-click AI actions in detail to switch provider / model / rules. See [Model settings](#model-settings).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Share link parsing failed?</b></summary>

**A:** Check the network. If the site needs a proxy, enable or enter one under **Network proxy**, or try auto-detect.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I share with others?</b></summary>

**A:** Use **Share** in detail, or export selected groups in **Batch manage**. See [Share package](#share-package).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How is NSFW handled?</b></summary>

**A:** Enable auto rating and default blur under **Content rating**. Temporary reveal in detail; batch regrade supported. See [NSFW rating](#nsfw-rating).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Video features unavailable?</b></summary>

**A:** Video cards, keyframes, and video compress need video support. Confirm it is enabled; reinstall or update if needed.
